# Body Language

​	I try my best to discuss the number of 166's speech.  Her topic is Round Table. She  Marvellously speak every section of speech with no pause. The more excellent part of her is her body language.

​	So So when we think of nonverbals, we think of how we judge others, how they judge us and what the outcomes are. We tend to forget, though, the other audience that's influenced by our nonverbals, and that's ourselves. Her nonverbals following her speech rhythm. Each of climax of speach where she wave her hand or shake arm at .  A awesome rhythm can make others pay more attention to the speech. That's what she did.

​	Anyway .when you at speeching.Try follow you rythm .Don't put your hand on the table last over 5 minutes.make others pay attention to you is the most important.
